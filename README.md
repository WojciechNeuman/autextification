# Autextification

Shouldn't we have the right to know who wrote what we read? The truth is that it's becoming increasingly challenging to distinguish between human-written and AI-generated texts. This project is about building a robust AI detector at Iberian languages, which include `Spanish`, `Catalan`, `Basque`, and `English` (the one from Gibraltar). This is also the repository where we keep track of our progress in the **autextification** contest.

## What is autextification?

> Link to the contest: https://sites.google.com/view/iberautextification/home

IberAuTexTification is the second version of the AuTexTification at IberLEF 2023 shared task (Sarvazyan et al., 2023). This context includes more models, more domains and more languages than the previous one. 

## How to download this repository?

In the folder where you want to have our repository, run the following line:
> git lfs clone https://github.com/WojciechNeuman/autextification.git

## How should I move in this repository?
We are keeping the general code (one for each of the six languages) and then some specifics arrangements for each language in each branch. In the future we will merge all of them.

## Who is contributing to this repository?

We've divided the project into 4 groups, so each one focuses on one Iberian language.
